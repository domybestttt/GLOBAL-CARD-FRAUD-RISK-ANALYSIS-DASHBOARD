## DAX Measures
```dax
FRAUD RATE % = DIVIDE('card_risk_analysis_dataset'[FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION],COUNTROWS('card_risk_analysis_dataset'),0)*100
FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('card_risk_analysis_dataset'),'card_risk_analysis_dataset'[Fraud Flag] = 1)
FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION AMOUNT = CALCULATE([TOTAL AMOUT TRANSACTION],'card_risk_analysis_dataset'[Fraud Flag]=1)
HIGH RISK TRANSACTION = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('card_risk_analysis_dataset'),'card_risk_analysis_dataset'[Risk Level]="High"),COUNTROWS('card_risk_analysis_dataset'),0)*100
TOTAL AMOUT TRANSACTION = SUM('card_risk_analysis_dataset'[Amount Spent (USD)])
